        <p> 
            Ever wanted to have you own online card catalog? Shelf Life offers that functionality and a few extras!
            Use the searh function to search for books you have in your collection and add them to your personal library.
            Once you have your library built, use the collection function to update the status of the book, as well as give
            it your own personal rating. Once you have, shelf life will auto update charts that will reflect the data you
            entered so you can see data related to your collection! Also, please check the about page from the footer for more
            information about Shelf Life and future planned features!
