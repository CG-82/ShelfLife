            <h1>About Shelf Life</h1>
            <p>
              Shelf life was designed to help you manage your home library collection. The Search button helps you search for information
              about books you own or are interested in, including brief summaries if available. Once you find a book you're interested in you can add it to your
              personal library. Once your selection is there, you can use the Collection button to view the books you've selected at any time and update their status and rating.
              The app will automatically update the charts with the changes set by the user. All information is stored in a React context API called LibraryContext, allowing
              the information to be used by all components and saved to local storage. There is room for improvement, however, and this page details some changes I'm considering in the future.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Instead of using boolean statement on button clicks to change the displayed content, I'm considering moving to React Routes. This would mean all the contnt would have its own
                    page and style would not change. It would decomplicate some code and possibly improve overall performance.
                </li>
                <li>I plan on adding more functionality to the collection page. These would include things like the ability to sort and filter your library according by title, author, rating, etc. </li>
                <li>While using local storage has worked to prove my design concept and make it functional, it is not ideal. Having a longer lasting solution would be better if the app is actually deployed.
                    It would also benefit from secure access so unauthorized users cannot access info about your library. To that end, I may employ express at some point to adddress these issues.
                </li>
